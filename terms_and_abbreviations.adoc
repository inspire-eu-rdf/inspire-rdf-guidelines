== Terms

application schema:: conceptual schema for data required by one or more applications <<iso_19101>>

conversion rule:: rule for converting instances in the input data structure to instances in the output data structure <<iso_19118>> 

data interchange:: delivery, receipt and interpretation of data <<iso_19118>>  
 
data transfer:: movement of data from one point to another over a medium <<iso_19118>> +
 +
NOTE  Transfer of information implies transfer of data. 
 
encoding:: conversion of data into a series of codes <<iso_19118>>  
 
encoding rule:: identifiable collection of conversion rules that define the encoding for a particular data structure <<iso_19118>> +
 + 
 NOTE  An encoding rule specifies the types of data to be converted as well as the syntax, structure 
and codes used in the resulting data structure. 

transfer format:: structured representation of data in a file for transfer between systems + 
 +
 NOTE  Typically, a machine readable schema will document the structure of the data in the transfer 
file. +
 +
 EXAMPLE  GML <<iso_19136>> encodes the application schema in XML Schema. 

simple feature:: feature with all geometric attributes described piecewise by straight line or planar interpolation between sets of points <<ogc_sf>>

spatial data:: data with a direct or indirect reference to a specific location or geographic area <<inspire_directive>>  
 
spatial data set:: identifiable collection of spatial data <<inspire_directive>>  

spatial object:: abstract representation of a real-world phenomenon related to a specific location or geographical area <<inspire_directive>> 
 
NOTE: It should be noted that the term has a different meaning in the ISO 19100 series. It is also synonymous with "(geographic) feature" as used in the ISO 19100 series. 
 
spatial object type:: classification of spatial objects <<inspire_d25>>

NOTE: In the conceptual schema language UML a spatial object type will be described by a class with stereotype \<<featureType>>.

transfer protocol:: common set of rules for defining interactions between distributed systems <<iso_19118>>

== Verbal forms for the expression of provisions
In accordance with the ISO rules for drafting, the following verbal forms shall be interpreted in the given way: 

* "shall" / "shall not": a requirement, mandatory for every data specification 
* "should" / "should not": a recommendation, but an alternative approach may be chosen for a specific case if there are reasons to do so 
* "may" / "need not": a permission

To make it easier to identify the mandatory requirements, the recommendations, and the permissions for INSPIRE data specifications in the text, they are highlighted and have an identifier.

[REQUIREMENT, id="REQ/OWL/A/B/C"]

[RECOMMENDATION, id="REC/OWL/X/Y/Z"]

[PERMISSION, id="PMS/OWL/X/Y/Z"]

Specific notes are also highlighted. They do not have normative character.

NOTE: This is a note.
